**Unit test** is an automated piece of code (usually a method), which invokes [[Unit of work]] and checks some assumptions about a single end result of that unit.
If the assumptions are not confirmed, it is said that the test failed.
A unit test’s scope can span as little as a method or as much as multiple classes.

## Good Unit Test Should

+ be automated and repeatable. 
+ be easy to implement. 
+ be relevant tomorrow.
+ Anyone should be able to run it at the push of a button. 
+ run quickly. 
+ be consistent in its results (it always returns the same result if you don’t change anything between runs). 
- have full control of the unit under test.
- be fully isolated (runs independently of other tests). 
- When it fails, be easy to detect what was expected and determine how to pinpoint the problem.
