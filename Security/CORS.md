Cross Origin Resource Sharing - a mechanism via which the server indicates where browser may load resources from if the source comes from another server (origin).

1. Based on [[HTTP_Headers]] and [[Pre-flight request]]
2. Headers describe who can read data requested by browser
3. By default browser may only load content from its original server ([[Same_Origin_Policy]])

Examples: fonts, load resources from CDN, fetch requests.
